# Factors-of-a-number
Write a program that will keep running (i.e., doing what is being asked 
below), till the user inputs an 'N' (for exit).
• Ask the user for a number.
• The program should display all positive factors of the number that is 
input.
o For instance, if the user inputs 100, all factors of 100 are 
displayed. The factors are:
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
o Similarly, if the user inputs 150, all factors of 150 are displayed. 
The factors are:
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150
Then, if the total number of Factors is
o Less than 10: Display "This is too less. Do you want to 
Continue?". If the user inputs an “N”, the Program Ends !, if the 
user inputs a “Y”, ask the user for a number again, and so on…
o More than 10: Do the following
§ Display the highest 3 factors (e.g. for 150 - the highest 3 
factors are 50, 75, 150)
§ Display the average of the above 3 factors (e.g. for 150 -
average is 91.667). Then display “Do you want to 
Continue?”. If the user inputs an “N”, the Program Ends !, if 
the user inputs a “Y”, ask the user for a number again, and 
so on…
